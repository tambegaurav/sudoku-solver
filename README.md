# Sudoku Solver - [Live Demo](https://dumb-sudoku-solver.netlify.app/)


## Introduction

This is my first algorithmic project using javascript.

This project uses backtracking algorithm to solve 9 * 9 Sudoku Puzzle.

It not only solves the problem but visualizes how the algorithm works.

## What is backtracking?

In simple words, backtracking is a dumb way to solve sudoku where the computer tries out every possibility.

And everytime it gets stuck on some try, it takes a step back and try another number.

In techninal words, Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem. (Source - wiki)
